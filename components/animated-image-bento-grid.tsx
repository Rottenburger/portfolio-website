          description="My industrial year placement provided me with an exceptional experience in systems administration, IT support and cyber security operations. I used a vast array of different technologies, 
          including PowerShell, Mimecast, CyberArk, VMWare, Citrix and Cisco Meraki to name a few. During the second half of my placement I worked under a senior IT engineer completing engineering project tickets. This 
          included an automated checking system for new joiners of the company to ensure that their accounts and storage were setup correctly. I also spent time learning Linux system administration/engineering 
          to gain more understanding about the operating system as I had very little experience with it before joining G-Research. During a re-structuring while at G-Research, I was given more responsibility for 
          the cyber-security operations at the company. Handling email releases, download requests as well as working with the security investigation team when an account had been compromised/labelled as suspicious.

The role gave me a great deal of experience on how to handle customer demands as well as solve problems on my own."
